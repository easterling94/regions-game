# Reg-game general

The aim of the project is to build app which may help to remember any repetitive and similar information. Pairs of Russian region names and corresponding codes were used as an example. This add consists of two parts: registration form and game interface. 

If admin needs to update regions through interface (not inside of a json file) then admin may use registration mode. For any other users - gaming mode is awailable.

# Game interface - updates in development

1. Language change via React i18next;
2. CSS transition apply when state of header correct / lives / hints changes.

# Registration mode - updates in development

1. Autofocus after pressing edit button;

# Mocking JSON-server

JSON-server should be started to perform add/delete functionality in registration mode. In a web version data is hardcoded.

# Open source name/code pair

The data for pairing regions name and codes was collected from open resource - 'https://www.zr.ru/content/articles/923507-vse-tsifrovye-kody-na-regional/'

# Web version with only game interface funciton
